🚀 Trackify – AI-Based Missing Child Detection System
👩‍💻 Built with passion by Rakshitha Meleyyanavar
🎯 Empowering the search for missing children using AI and face recognition

🧠 Overview

Trackify is a real-time AI-based facial recognition system that assists in detecting and identifying 
missing children using face matching algorithms. 
Designed for scalability, accuracy, and social impact, this tool bridges the gap between reported
missing cases and live facial recognition across databases.

🌟 Key Features

🔍 Face Detection & Recognition – Uses dlib & HOG face encodings for robust face matching
🧠 Custom Facial Dataset Matching – Matches unknown faces with stored missing child images
📸 Live Video Feed Support – Real-time webcam integration for surveillance usage
📁 Report Matcher Module – Maps detected matches to pre-stored case report info
🧰 Lightweight & Offline Capable – No internet dependency, runs on local machine
📊 Scalable Design – Extendable for law enforcement or NGO datasets


📸 Sample Workflow

📥 Load known face images of missing children (images1/)
🔍 Run main.py to start webcam-based detection
🧠 System identifies any matching face and fetches the report
📄 report_matcher.py prints matched child's info

🌍 Real-World Applications

🚔 Police Surveillance Cameras
📍 Bus & Railway Stations
🧒 NGOs tracking missing children
🧾 Citizen Reporting Tools...

💡 Future Enhancements

🔁 Integrate MongoDB for live report storing
🌐 Connect with online missing child databases
🤖 Add voice assistant for reporting matched cases
📱 Mobile version for field officers
